## Usage 
This OBC is used for controlling the actions based on circumstances during the balloons upward trajectory.

### Explaination of the main file
The file that runs the entire program is [main.c](https://github.com/UVicSatelliteDesign/HAB_OBC/blob/18-documentation/Core/Src/main.c).
> [Main.c](https://github.com/UVicSatelliteDesign/HAB_OBC/blob/18-documentation/Core/Src/main.c) is run based on the function [StartPollingLoop](https://github.com/UVicSatelliteDesign/HAB_OBC/blob/fa95cb4608e997175df61c51ad960b2182373af1/Core/Src/main.c#L936). 
As a method of further understanding the code, tracing backwards starting from the [StartPollingLoop](https://github.com/UVicSatelliteDesign/HAB_OBC/blob/fa95cb4608e997175df61c51ad960b2182373af1/Core/Src/main.c#L936) function assists in simplifying the flow of the code.
